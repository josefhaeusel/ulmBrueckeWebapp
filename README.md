Commissioned by or in collaboration with the Smart Circular Bridge project.

## 🎯 Project Overview
https://github.com/josefhaeusel/ulmBrueckeWebapp/blob/main/README.md
This project presents the innovative **Smart Circular Bridge** in Ulm—a pioneering structure built from flax fibers and bio-based resins. The bridge not only exemplifies sustainable construction but also transforms into a musical instrument, translating pedestrian movements into sound.

Key features:

- **Bio-based Construction**: Utilizes flax fibers and recycled PET foam, resulting in a lightweight yet robust structure.
- **Interactive Sound Experience**: Equipped with 42 sensors that capture movements and environmental changes, converting them into auditory feedback.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous data collection for structural health monitoring, aiding research in sustainable materials.
